# Robot-Arm-Torque-Calculator
This is a calculator used for a project for school. For my physics class I had to come up with the length and angle parameters for a 3 degree of freedom robotic arm. The objective was to minimize the torque at the base of the arm. To avoid all the messy hand calculations I programmed this calculator.
